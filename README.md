# 🗣️ Virtual Assistant System from Scratch

## 📌 Project Description

This project aims to develop a **Virtual Assistant System from scratch**, leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Python libraries introduced during the course. The assistant will be capable of understanding voice commands and executing automated tasks.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Implement a module for **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** conversion.
- Implement a module for **Speech-to-Text (STT)** conversion.
- Enable voice-activated commands to perform actions such as:
  - Searching Wikipedia
  - Opening YouTube
  - Locating the nearest pharmacy

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- SpeechRecognition
- pyttsx3 / gTTS (Text-to-Speech)
- pyaudio / sounddevice
- Webbrowser
- Geolocation APIs (optional)

## 📚 Supporting Materials

- [Text to Speech Example](https://github.com/diegobrunoDIO/Text-to-Speech-DIO)
- [Speech to Text Example](https://github.com/diegobrunoDIO/Speech-to-text-ML-DIO)
- Slides from the course module (available in the learning platform)
